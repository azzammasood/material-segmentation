# Human Perception-based Color Masking System in Python
The Human Perception-based Color Masking System is a Python-based project that focuses on extracting and masking colors from an image, taking into account the natural human perception of colors. The primary goal of this project is to create an intuitive and efficient color masking tool that can identify and isolate colors in an image, while considering the way humans perceive and differentiate them.

The project involves the following key steps:

1. Image preprocessing: Load and preprocess the input image by converting it to the appropriate color space (e.g., RGB or LAB) and resizing it if necessary to optimize the computational efficiency of the project.

2. Color extraction: Extract all unique colors from the image using image processing techniques, such as pixel-by-pixel color analysis or a color quantization algorithm, to create a color palette representing the input image.

3. Human perception-based clustering: Implement a clustering algorithm, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, considering color similarity as perceived by humans. This could involve utilizing a color difference formula, like CIEDE2000 or CIELAB, which takes into account the human perception of color differences. The clustering process groups similar colors together, resulting in a set of representative colors that closely align with the human perception of distinct colors in the image.

4. Mask generation: For each representative color obtained from the clustering step, create a binary mask that highlights the regions in the image containing that specific color. This mask isolates the corresponding color, allowing users to manipulate or analyze the color distribution in the image effectively.

5. User interaction: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to select an input image, adjust the clustering parameters, and visualize the generated color masks. This interface should enable users to fine-tune the masking process based on their specific requirements.

Upon successful completion of the Human Perception-based Color Masking System, users will have access to an efficient and intuitive tool for isolating and analyzing colors in images. This system can be applied to various domains, including image editing, computer vision, design, and art, offering a more natural and human-centric approach to color manipulation and analysis.
